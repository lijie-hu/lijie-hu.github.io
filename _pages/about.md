Hello! I am Lijie Hu, a final-year Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) since Spring 2021, and I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://shao3wangdi.github.io/">Di Wang</a> in <a href="https://pradalab1.github.io/">PRADA Lab</a> (Provable Responsible AI and Data Analytics Lab). Before that, I received my Master's degree in Mathematics from Renmin University of China.

My research interests are Explainable AI and Privacy-preserving ML. Specifically, my research goals are to develop <b>Usable XAI-as-a-Service systems (Usable XAI)</b> and <b>Useful Explainable AI toolkits (Useful XAI)</b>. Here, usable refers to providing a service for model understanding characterized by faithfulness. Useful means the toolkit can serve as a guide for boosting performance and enhancing the trustworthiness of deep learning models. My research helps realize these goals by making progress in the following four directions:

- <b>Theoretical Foundations of Usable XAI:</b> stability(<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YdwwWRX20q">[ICML'24 Spotlight]</a>,<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rp0EdI8X4e">[ICLR'24]</a>,<a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26517">[AAAI'23 Oral]</a>), controllability(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11667">[ArXiv1]</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15476" >[ArXiv2]</a>), consistency(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21494">[NeurIPS'24]</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06606">[EMNLP'24,a]</a>)
- <b>Useful XAI in Large Models:</b> enhance safety([AAAI'25 Oral,a],<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06331">[ArXiv3]</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09022">[NAACL'25]</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17695" >[AAAI'25 Oral,b]</a>,<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Nd950RAcCW#discussion">[COLM'24,a]</a>,<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=FX4fUThO9H#discussion">[COLM'24,b]</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06606">[EMNLP'24 Oral,b]</a>), boost model performance(<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=yrnrvfXFaV">[ArXiv]</a>), steer model behavior(<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03595">[ArXiv]</a>)
- <b>System for XAI:</b> acceleration
- <b>XAI for Science:</b> healthcare(<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rp0EdI8X4e">[ICLR'24]</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21494">[NeurIPS'24]</a>), traffic, material science, marine science

For privacy-preserving machine learning, I mainly focused on private statistical estimation(<a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/v24/21-0523.html">[JMLR,a]</a>,<a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/v25/22-0079.html">[JMLR,b]</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13520">[ECAI'23]</a>,<a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/hu23a/hu23a.pdf">[AISTATS'23]</a>,<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10314000">[TKDE]</a>,<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3517804.3524144">[PODS'22]</a>,<a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v167/su22a/su22a.pdf">[ALT'22]</a>) and its application to natural language models(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08027">[EMNLP'24 Oral,c]</a>,<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-eacl.33/">[EACL'24]</a>).

## Openings

<b style="color: #DC1435">I will be joining the <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research-department/machine-learning-department/">Machine Learning Department</a> at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/">MBZUAI</a> in August 2025. I am seeking several highly motivated PhD students/ Postdocs/RAs/Visiting PhD students. PhD positions begin in Fall 2025 or Fall 2026. Postdocs/RAs/Visiting PhD students can start anytime. If you are interested in working with me, please email your CV, academic transcript, and a brief outline of your research plan.</b>
