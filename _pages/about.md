Hello! I am Lijie Hu, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) since Spring 2021, and I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://shao3wangdi.github.io/">Di Wang</a> in <a href="https://pradalab1.github.io/">PRADA Lab</a> (Provable Responsible AI and Data Analytics Lab). Before that, I received my Master's degree in Mathematics from Renmin University of China.

My research interests are Explainable AI and Privacy-preserving AI. Specifically, my research goal is to build faithful XAI systems that are easily understood by users and are robust in various environments, especially for large models (e.g., large language models and large multimodal). I am also interested in applying the XAI to real-world scenarios (e.g., healthcare, recommender systems, traffic forecasting, materials, etc.).
