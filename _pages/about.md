Hello! I am Lijie Hu, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) since Spring 2021, and I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://shao3wangdi.github.io/">Di Wang</a> in <a href="https://pradalab1.github.io/">PRADA Lab</a> (Provable Responsible AI and Data Analytics Lab). Before that, I received my Master's degree in Mathematics from Renmin University of China.

My research interests are Explainable AI and Privacy-preserving AI. Specifically, my research goals are to develop <b>Usable XAI-as-a-Service systems (Usable XAI)</b> and <b>Useful Explainable AI toolkits (Useful XAI)</b>. Here usable refers to providing a service for model understanding characterized by faithfulness. Useful means the toolkit can serve as a guide for boosting performance and enhancing the trustworthiness of deep learning models. My research has helped to realize these goals by making progress in the following three directions:

- <b>Theoretical Foundations of Usable XAI:</b> stability, controllability, consistency
- <b>Towards Useful XAI in Large Models:</b> cognitive neuroscience, hallucination, jailbreaking, privacy, copyright
- <b>Towards Usable XAI for Science:</b> healthcare, traffic, material science, marine science
